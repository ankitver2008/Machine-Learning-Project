# Machine-Learning-Project
The objective of this project was to build various Machine Learning models on this data set and based on the accuracy metrics decide which model is to be finalised for finally predicting the target variable.

Problem Statement:

You work for an office transport company. You are in discussions with ABC Consulting company for providing transport for their employees. For this purpose, you are tasked with understanding how do the employees of ABC Consulting prefer to commute presently (between home and office). Based on the parameters like age, salary, work experience etc. given in the data set ‘Transport.csv’, you are required to predict the preferred mode of transport. The project requires you to build several Machine Learning models and compare them so that the model can be finalised.

Objective:

The objective is to build various Machine Learning models on this data set and based on the accuracy metrics decide which model is to be finalised for finally predicting the mode of transport chosen by the employee.

Result:

The EDA was conducted on the Data available, and the following Machine Learning models were built:

1. Logistic regression Model
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. Decision Tree - CART
4. Random Forest Model
5. KNN classifier model
6. Boosting Classifier using XGboost

The models were compared based on confusion matrix and ROC AUC curve.
